# Graduate-Admission-Parameters-Analysis

The goal of this project is to propose a solution which helps potential students / candidates assess their chances of admittance to a university based on their overall profile with the help of a predicted admittance score. This predicted output score gives the student a fair idea about the chances of admittance to a particular university. This information can be very useful for students looking to quickly shortlist the universities that are a right match for their profile. My solution should also help the students save up on a lot of hours which they can devote towards further improvement of their profile.

This project also aims to identify which of the variables are the most important and in what capacity are all the factors inter-related with one another.
